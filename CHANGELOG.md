component. It includes normalize, normalize-legacy-addon, variables (including
cf-colors), media query and utility mixins, class utilities and standard base
styling (including cf-typography and some base styles from cf-forms).

All Capital Framework components that used to depend any of the following will
move to using cf-core instead: normalize, normalize-legacy-addon, cf-typography,
or cf-colors.
